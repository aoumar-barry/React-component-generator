# SQL Query Optimizer - Prompts

**Prompt 1:**
```
now we gonna build the third tool, a sql query optimizer. for the design: original query and optimized query at the right side ( original query must not be streamed ). An explanation in the middle of the section with streaming and interpreted markdown. if you're not sure about 70% on how to proceed ask for more details or explanations before you start
```

**Prompt 2:**
```
the original should appear with a smooth transition, both queries must be stacked vertically, the explanation in the left side 70% width and the textarea at the bottom. but when the page loads, the text area must be at the middle and when the user hit submits, a very nice and smooth transition put it now in the bottom.
```

**Prompt 3:**
```
when the user hits the submit button send the request to the model to generate an optimized query
```

**Prompt 4:**
```
add a nice and smooth transition, when the user submits the query
```
