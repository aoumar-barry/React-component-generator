```

**Prompt 2:**
```
for rhe moment, only implement phase 1, if everything is ok we'll move to the next one
```

**Prompt 3:**
```
great, start phase 2
```

**Prompt 4:**
```
the language auto detection is not working correctly, you can try in the backend to call the model twice, one for getting the right language and the second to generate the unit tests. what do you think about that
```

**Prompt 5:**
```
When there's no content pasted, do not show the language detection, show it only when the model responds
```

**Prompt 6:**
```
i have this issue in the browser, can you fix it before we move on: [Error Type: Console Error - Hydration Mismatch]
