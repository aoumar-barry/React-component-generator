# React Component Generator - Prompts

**Prompt 1:**
```
Give me a very detailled plan on how to build a web app with no authentication where a user can describe a react component and get the code of that component. he'll be able to copy by clicking on the icon the entire generated code. if you're not sure about 90% of how to proceed on a feature ask me for more details or clarifications
```

**Prompt 2:**
```
now give me the steps by steps overview on how to build it from the beginning to the end so i can validate and follow along before we start
```

**Prompt 3:**
```
ok you can start from step 1 to step 6
```

**Prompt 4:**
```
implement step 7 so i can run the app and test the ui a little bit
```

**Prompt 5:**
```
i would like a tiny loader that shows aside because i can the response to be streamed so i get to set what's generate by the model
```

**Prompt 6:**
```
now i want you to work on the preview of the generated component so i can see and test it right away
```

**Prompt 7:**
```
you can remove the live preview feature
```

**Prompt 8:**
```
i would like the interface to look like this image
```

**Prompt 9:**
```
replace this text 'What are you working on?' by 'react component generator'
```

**Prompt 10:**
```
make each first letter in the words uppercase
```

**Prompt 11:**
```
double the font-size of the text
```

**Prompt 12:**
```
the text 'react component Generation' must be bold and centered with the textarea horizontally and vertically with 80% of the left side width
```

**Prompt 13:**
```
remove the mic icon in the textarea
```

**Prompt 14:**
```
the openai and openai should be a dropdown and must be at the place of the plus icon. the default value selected will be openai
```

**Prompt 15:**
```
when i click on the generate butotn i woudl like the generated code to be at the right of the page with 30% width. if it's not splitted yet there should be a really nice and modern transition to guide the user to look at the right for the transition
```

**Prompt 16:**
```
now we gonna add a little bit of precaution, before generating the code we gonna ask the model to check if the question is related to react compoment, if yes the model can proceed and generate the corresponding code, and if not the model can just respond with an appropiate answer and letting the user know what we can generate with this app
```

**Prompt 17:**
```
instead of having that helpful message, i would like to get a response form the model itself
```

**Prompt 18:**
```
i would like the model to do a check if the question is not about 70% about react component generation, it should respond by letting the user know that he can only genrate react component
```

**Prompt 19:**
```
ok great we gonna add a security measre you can not genenrate more than 50 tokens. that's the limit. if you reach it just stop streaming and let the user know that
```

**Prompt 20:**
```
ok it's stop when it reaches 50 tokens, i would like a fade out message that let the user know. the message should last for 10 seconds
```

**Prompt 21:**
```
the message shoudl appear on the bottom right of the right side section with a 20 px margin-bottom
```

**Prompt 22:**
```
the fade out message must be at the right side or the right section
```

**Prompt 23:**
```
no it shoudl appear at the bottom-right of the right section with a margin bottom of 20px
```

**Prompt 24:**
```
remove the fade out message and the fixed message error in the right section and only conserve the one in the left section
```

**Prompt 25:**
```
ok great now set the max token to 1000
```

**Prompt 26:**
```
which model are you calling for the openai
```

**Prompt 27:**
```
i would like you to use gpt-4o-mini
```
